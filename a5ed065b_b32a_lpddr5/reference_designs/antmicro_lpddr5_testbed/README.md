## Overview

This project contains open hardware design files for an experimental test module in a mechanical form of SO-DIMM DDR5. 

The module includes a standard 315-ball WFBGA (12.4mm × 15.0mm × 0.8mm, Ø0.42 SMD) LPDDR5 RAM footprint break-routed in the SO-DIMM edge connector. 
The design files were prepared in KiCad 9.x. 

Please note that this board is not electrically compatible with off-the-shelf hot platforms accepting SO-DIMM DDR5 memory modules. 
It is compatible with [this](https://github.com/antmicro/sodimm-ddr5-tester) test platform.
